                        <p>First of all, we’d like to apologize as this is out of our control. The biggest reason why return shipping can be expensive is that our warehouse is located in the Philippines. For customers who want to have their exchange processed quickly opt for express international shipping (the duties of which will not be covered by Skoop). However, most of our customers opt to ship returns via USPS or standard postal mail (which could take up to a month for delivery) for $10 to save on costs.</p>
